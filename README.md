Krushi Sahayak

Overview:
Krushi Sahayak is a machine learning-based project designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions regarding soil classification and crop recommendations. By leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the model accurately classifies soil types and suggests suitable crops to optimize agricultural productivity.

Features:
Soil Classification: Predicts the type of soil based on given parameters.
Crop Recommendation: Suggests the best crops suited for the classified soil type.
Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes a CNN model for soil classification.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an easy-to-use interface for farmers.

Technologies Used:
Python
TensorFlow/Keras (for CNN Model)
Pandas & NumPy (for data preprocessing)
OpenCV (for image processing, if applicable)
Flask/Streamlit (for deployment, if included)

Installation:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/AsmitaChorge/-Krushi_Sahayak.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd Krushi_Sahayak

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:
python app.py  # Modify if using a different framework

Dataset:
The dataset used for training the CNN model includes soil samples with labeled categories. If applicable, it can be found in the data/ directory or linked separately.

Usage:
Upload or input soil sample details.
The model processes the data and classifies the soil type.
Recommended crops are displayed based on the classified soil type.

Future Enhancements:
Expanding the dataset for better accuracy.
Adding more parameters such as climate conditions.
Integrating a mobile application for accessibility.
